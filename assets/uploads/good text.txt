yes, since my project is a game project there are a lot of logical things to be done. for example, the system will be calling numbers, and they have to be shown on each of the playing users screens without the users needing to refresh their game pages what they are going to do is just mark their cards and press the Bingo! button when they think they have won the game, then the system has to check if the player who pressed bingo if they has won or not so if they win everyone gets notified that someone just won the game and if they were about to cheat, they get disqualified and the game continues. How do we implement this?
